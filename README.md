A Poc Writing data onto googlemaps using angular4

To keep my Google API key secret it is not stored in source control.
To run this code add a file called env.js in the /src folder, next to index.html.

eg:
/**
 * env.js
 * KEEP OUT OF SOURCE CONTROL!
 */
env = {
		"apikey": 'YOUR_KEY'
}
